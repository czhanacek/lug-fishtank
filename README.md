# LUG Fish Tank

### 1. How to install

- Clone this repository
- Make sure you have SFML and make installed (ex. apt-get install libsfml-dev build-essential)
- Run "make all" - This will build an native executable binary with g++ 
- Run "./lug-fishtank" - enjoy the fish

### 2. Limitations
- No command line arguments. Fish number is hardcoded.
- All fish are the same and obey the same rules. Boring.
